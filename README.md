### Run application and unit tests

#### `npm install`

Use the above command to install any dependencies the project needs as saved in package.json

#### `npm start`

Use the above command to bring up the application during the development. It opens up your default browser with [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

#### `npm test`

Use the above command to validate all the existing unit test cases.

#### `npm test:dev`

Use the above command during development and unit test cases will be launched watch mode.


### Future Improvements

Feel free to elaborate on how you would improve any of the following topics 

* Code Structuring:

I like to breakdown the components into as smaller as I can so they can be reused, render conditionally or render specific features using the flags. As this helps the developers segregate the components and the code which would then reduce the effort for the new developers to easily dig through the code and get to the point for change. 

* Refactoring:

I would like to update few of the components to be more generic by briging out all the constants defined locally and explore into GraphQL to optimize the query for an efficient response.


* Additional Features:

I would like to add auto complete feature  to the search input that will help user to identify the criteria from the list of suggestions available. 

I would be adding a little related information for each topic for the user to get an idea what that list belongs to and probably use routes to display the information and related topics.

### Observations

As it is my first time to actually get some hands on GraphQL, while exploring few open source projects I got a clear view over the functionality and dynamics of GraphQL and other libraries. It is really interesting how it can accomplish the queries.
